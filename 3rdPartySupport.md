## Our addon policy
We allow every addon *(plugin, mod, resource pack, external tool)* on this list as long as it generally works and uses
BlueMap's API or was at least partially made for it in some way.  
That means we do not exhaustively test and review every aspect of every new entry, and we cannot guarantee that the addons on
this list will work for your use case.   
We also do not guarantee the safety of your system when you install any
addons from this list, even though we try to remove actively harmful addons as soon as possible.

**Reasons for a removal of an addon include:**
- The addon being outdated and no longer maintained
- Fatal issues/bugs that could irreversibly harm your server
- Malware, Spyware and other intentionally harmful software

If you feel like an addon on this list fulfills one of these criteria, report it (Github or Discord) and we will decide if the issue warrants a removal.
