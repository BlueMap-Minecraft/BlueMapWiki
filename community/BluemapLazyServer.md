# What will this guide cover? (and what is a lazy server?)
{: .no_toc }

We're using "lazy server" here to describe a Minecraft server that's only running when players are
actively using it. This is a great way to conserve resources on a server that doesn't have players
on it 24/7. However, hosting BlueMap on these types of servers presents a problem because when the
server is offline, the BlueMap integrated webserver is offline as well.

This guide will go over setting up a lazy Minecraft server with BlueMap enabled and detail a setup
that allows for 24/7 viewing of the map (and map markers), even when the server is offline.

## Setting up a lazy server

The [lazymc] project can be used to set up a lazy Minecraft server. Essentially it acts just enough
like a normal Minecraft server to accept an incoming connection request, start the Minecraft server
(if not already running) and transparently proxy the connection through to it.

Once the server is running, it monitors the number of current players and shuts it down once it's
empty. It can also be configured to pause the Minecraft server instead of shutting it down so it can
be instantly resumed when the next player connects.

Detailed instructions on how to set up and configure lazymc are available in the project's README.


## Configuring BlueMap

Install and configure BlueMap as desired (see [Getting Started]).

For this guide, we're going to assume BlueMap is storing all data using the `FILE`-type storage with
`GZIP` compression enabled as this is the default configuration. It's definitely possible to make
this work for `SQL`-type storage and uncompressed map data as well, but it will require some
extra work not covered by this guide.

Since we're going to be using an external webserver there's no need to expose the BlueMap integrated
webserver to the world. To make the server local-only, in `webserver.conf`, add `ip: "127.0.0.1"`
just above the existing `port: <some port>` setting. Make a note of what `<some port>` is in your
config since you'll need it later.


## Configuring an external webserver to serve the map

Because the Minecraft server (and therefore the integrated BlueMap webserver) is not always going to
be online, we need to use something else to host the BlueMap webapp and resources. This guide will
provide a configuration example for [Nginx], but the same general idea can be applied to any other
webserver as well.

Most of this configuration is going to be the exact same as is detailed on the [External Webservers
(FILE-Storage)] page so to understand the basics, it might be worth it to give that page a quick
skim first. The difference in this case is that we're *expecting* that the integrated webserver will
be down when the server is offline and the proxy should therefore return some placeholder data to
keep the frontend happy.

Note that if [lazymc] is configured to pause the server instead of shutting it down, Nginx will need
to be configured with a short `proxy_read_timeout` to avoid hanging while waiting for a response
from the integrated webserver. This is because the paused server will accept the connection but not
be able to respond in any way to the request.


## Faking "live" data while server is offline

The frontend attempts to load live data (markers, players) from endpoints under
`/maps/<world>/live/`.

When shutting down (and periodically) BlueMap will write out the current live state to files in
`<webroot>/maps/<world>/live/`. These files conveniently have the exact path that the frontend is
looking for so we can just service the request normally from the webroot (falling back to a 204 No
Content response if the requested file doesn't exist).


## Example Nginx config

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name yourdomain.com;

  # path to bluemap-webroot, BlueMap can also be used in a sub-folder .. just adapt the paths accordingly
  root /var/www;

  location /maps/ {
    # All high-res tile data and some json data is precompressed into *.gz files
    gzip_static always;

    # Return 204 No Content if requesting a missing tile
    location ~* ^/maps/[^/]*/tiles/ {
      error_page 404 = @no-content;
    }

    # Proxy all requests for live data to the integrated webserver.
    # Fall back to @server-offline if it can't be contacted.
    location ~* ^/maps/[^/]*/live/ {
      proxy_read_timeout 2s;  # required if lazymc pauses the server instead of shutting it down
      error_page 502 504 = @server-offline;
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8100;  # the default port for the integrated webserver, adapt to your setup
    }
  }

  location @no-content {
    internal;
    return 204;
  }

  # Serve "live" data from the disk when the integrated webserver can't be reached
  location @server-offline {
    internal;
    try_files $uri =204;
  }
}
```
