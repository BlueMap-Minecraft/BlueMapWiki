# FAQ

### Q: Where can I open my map?
By default, it's your servers public ip-address (e.g. `123.45.67.8`) and the port (`8100`) like this: `http://123.45.67.8:8100/`<br>
*(Make sure you replace `123.45.67.8` with **your** server-ip. The same ip that you are using to connect to your minecraft-server!)*

### Q: I still can't access the website!
Here is a checklist:
- Do you get a message saying `Webserver started...` in your server-console/log? If not, look if there are any
  errors/warnings and check the configuration again.
- Is the port (`8100` by default) open and forwarded correctly? Or is your firewall blocking incoming connections 
  on the port? If you don't know this **ask your server-host how you can open a second port for BlueMap!**.

### Q: I am getting `404 - Not Found` when I open the map
Check your `core.conf` configuration file, did you set `accept-download` to `true`?<br>
If yes, check if your `webroot` settings in `render.conf` and `webserver.conf` are set to the correct (same) folder.

### Q: My map isn't updating!
BlueMap needs to wait until the server saves the world data to disk, so it may take some time for changes to appear 
on the map. Also make sure to click `Update Map` in the menu on the left to make your browser fetch a fresh copy.

### Q: Why is BlueMap using so much of my CPU?
When you install BlueMap for the first time, it needs to convert all of your world(s) into 3d models.
This is a pretty intensive process, so it's not strange at all to see BlueMap using up a lot of CPU power for a while after it's been installed.

In the BlueMap config file `core.conf` you can set how many threads BlueMap will use for the conversion process.
BlueMap runs asynchronously to your server-thread, so as long as the CPU isn't maxed out, it should not slow down your server.

After the conversion process is done for the first time, it won't ever have to render the whole map again!
From then on, BlueMap will keep track of your world and convert only the chunks that change.

If you do `/bluemap`, you can see the progress of the conversions and an estimated time that is left.

### Q: I have black/pink-checkered blocks on my map!
Read this: https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap/wiki/Configuring-mods

### Q: My block-textures are messed up when I zoom in on the map!
First, press the `Update Map` button in BlueMap's menu. This updates all tiles from the server and makes sure 
your browser has not cached anything weird.<br>
You can also try to clear your browser-cache completely. *(`F12` -> Network -> [x] Disable cache -> `F5`)*

If that doesn't help you might have changed some bluemap-settings that require a complete re-render of the map:
Just use `/bluemap purge <map-id>` to delete and re-render the entire map. Then clear your browser-cache again,
and it should be fixed :)

### Q: I have a black map / a lot of the map is missing!
- Press the `Update Map` button in BlueMap's menu. This updates all tiles from the server and makes sure your 
  browser has not cached anything weird.
- Use `/bluemap` to check if BlueMap is rendering something! It might be busy rendering a different map first.
- Make sure that the `world:`-setting in your map-config is set to the correct world-folder.
- Make sure your BlueMap-version supports the minecraft-version you are trying to render. *(You can see that on 
  BlueMap's [official download-page](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap/releases/latest))*
- BlueMap can only render the parts of your world that have already been generated by Minecraft! *(E.g., by exploring
  your world or using a plugin to pre-generate an area of your world.)*
- Use the command `/bluemap debug block` (in-game). If that is throwing an error, it is likely that you have a mod 
  installed that is not compatible with bluemap.
  Check the [incompatibilities-list](#known-incompatibilities-with-other-mods) below.
  If you don't have any mod from the list, please report the error
  [here](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap/issues).
- Have you upgraded your world from an earlier Minecraft-version? Or have you pre-generated your world or generated it with e.g. WorldPainter? 
  Then, chunks that have not been visited by a player **might** not have their light-data generated yet. 
  BlueMap needs the light data and ignores chunks that don't have it.
  So it will only render chunks that have been loaded by a player at least once.
- If nothing else works, you can try to set `ignore-missing-light-data: true` in your 
  map-config. *(And then use `/bluemap purge <map>` to update your map)*<br>
  This will ignore potentially missing light data while rendering, with some drawbacks:
    - Cave-rendering will always be enabled in those chunks, because it is using the sun-light data to detect the "caves"
    - Everything in those chunks will be rendered fully lit (sun-light value of 15, looks similar to having night-vision)

### Q: The map (web-app) is really slow (lagging)
Make sure you have **hardware-acceleration enabled** on your browser! 
Use your favorite search engine to learn how to do this :)

If you have a laptop with two GPU-units, make sure that the high-performance GPU is used for your browser. 
E.g. Intel/Nvidia sometimes like to use the low-performance GPU for your browser by default, to save energy.
You can change this in the Nvidia-Control-Panel.

### Q: How can I add or remove maps?
To add a map, copy a map-config from the `maps`-folder next to the other config-files, open it and tweak the settings 
for your new map. To remove a map, just delete the config-file.

### Q: How can i add SSL (HTTPS) to my map?
BlueMaps integrated webserver does not (and will not) support SSL on its own, 
but you can e.g. [use NGINX to reverse-proxy your map]({{site.baseurl}}/wiki/webserver/NginxProxy.html) 
and add SSL that way.
