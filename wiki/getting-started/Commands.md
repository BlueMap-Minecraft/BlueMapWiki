# Commands and Permissions

> **Usually you don't need to use ANY command for BlueMap to render and update the maps properly.**
> Even if you delete your world and create a new one, BlueMap should automatically detect this and delete the old map
> and render the new world, as long as the map is configured correctly.  
> Only if you changed some map-settings or other configuration that requires a re-render of the map, then you might need
> to manually purge the map.
{: .info }

Here is a table with all commands and their permissions that you can use if you use BlueMap as a plugin/mod:

> Arguments that look like `<this>` are **required**!  
> Arguments that look like `[this]` are **optional**!
