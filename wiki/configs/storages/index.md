# Storage Configs

Each file in this directory represents one configured storage backend.

There are two presets included out of the box, but you can create more, if you like.  
This is useful if you want to store your maps in different places.

You can control which storage each map is stored on, with the map's [`storage` option](../Maps.md#storage).
